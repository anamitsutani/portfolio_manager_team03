## Portfolio performance metrics

### Daily Gain
Daily gain for a single asset (in dollars) = Asset's current value - Asset's closing price from yesterday
The total daily gain, $T$, is the sum of the daily gain for all assets currently held by the user.
The total value of the portfolio held previously, $P$, is the sum of the closing prices of the assets.
Daily gain (%) = $(\frac{T}{P}) \cdot 100$
